# SFSF_KBAs
List of Knowledge Base Articles I had published for SuccessFactors while I was working at SAP.  
**Count of KBAs active as on the 25th of January 2022 - 125**  

SAP KBAs, like any other organization's Knowledge Base, could be modified anytime by the internale support team based on requirements.  
This means the KBAs I had created while I was working there could have a title change or could even be removed for public access.  
I had compiled the list of KBAs (KBA numbers are publicly available information) while I was working there.  
To ensure that I post only active KBAs here, I wrote a Python script to check a list of KBA numbers (KBA_list1.xlsx) and  
- Check and retain only publicly available KBAs
- Fetch the KBA's current title
- Create a markdown format for easier addition to this readme file  

I have attached the [KBA list](https://github.com/rthennan/SFSF_KBAs/blob/main/KBA_list1.xlsx) and the [Python script](https://github.com/rthennan/SFSF_KBAs/blob/main/kbaStatusCheck.py) to this repo as well
